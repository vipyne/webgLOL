# turn around flip it and reverse it

i tried [this](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-3:-3D-transformation-and-projection.html) but i think projection will be it's own branch.

[rotating the matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_two_dimensions)

i guess this would have been a good branch to name after a The Matrix reference, but i went with Missy Elliot.
