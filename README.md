# webgLOL

this is a playground for teaching myself webGL.
each branch chronicles my self directed curriculum
i'm looking at lot at [The Book of Shaders](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/).
the READMEs for each branch also contain more links about specific tasks that can be performed in webGL.

* 1-hello triangle
* 2-LOL
* 3-taste the rainbow
* 4-high school math
* 5-turn around flip it and reverse it
* 6-move it along
