# webgLOL

This is a playground for teaching myself webGL.
Checkout each branch to follow the chronicles my self directed curriculum.
I'm looking at lot at [The Book of Shaders](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/).
The READMEs for each branch also contain more links about specific tasks that can be performed in webGL.
All of these are in some state of work in progress, as I'd like to eventually have an explanatory comment for every line.

* 1-hello triangle (the hello world of openGL)
* 2-LOL (more than just triangles!)
* 3-taste the rainbow (animating colors)
* 4-high school math (remembering linear algebra)
* 5-turn around flip it and reverse it (rotating the matrix)

# turn around flip it and reverse it

i tried [this](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-3:-3D-transformation-and-projection.html) but i think projection will be it's own branch.

[rotating the matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_two_dimensions)

i guess this would have been a good branch to name after a The Matrix reference, but i went with Missy Elliot.


coming soon...

* 6-move it along (interactive events) (wip)
