# turn around flip it and reverse it

i tried to [rotate a world matrix](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-3:-3D-transformation-and-projection.html) to achieve this (which is the best practice) but I ended up [rotating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_two_dimensions) the vertices in the vertex shader; just to be different and illustrate different ways to attain desired results in GL land.
